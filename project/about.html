        <h2><strong>What is Index Trading?</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>Index Trading </strong> looks at the performance of a group of popular stocks and predicts whether their value will continue to rise in price or fall. This way of trading allows people to invest in multiple companies instead of just one. </p>

        <h2><strong>What is US30?</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>US30 </strong> also known as the Dow is a group of 30 diversified well-known companies in the US pooled together into one index. These popular companies hold different weights in the index and when the price of one company drops so does the performance of US30. For example, Apple is a popular company that will hold more weight in this index than another company, let's say the price of Apple drops one day. This will negatively affect the performance of the entire index or US30 because Apple holds a bigger value in the index. People benefit from trading US30 because it is less risky than trading individual stocks.</p>

Without a software like this it might be challenging to find all the information you need before making a trade as you would have to navigate different websites and pay several fees. Trading view lets you save all this information in one place using a free account. </p>
