        <h2>Personal Info:</h2>

        <p>My name is <strong>Jaime Vargas</strong>, I am an Information Management and Technology Major in hopes to better the future with technology. We use technology daily so why not learn about them to improve life and for it to help us know more about it as well. My problem-solving skill, communications, and my perfection skills are something I am grateful to have and use every day.</p> 
        <p>Outside of school, I am a daily options trader that spends most of the daily looking at charts and reading about news. During quarantine I learned about how to make money in the market and have been in love with it ever since. I am still learning and growing my skills with it so that real soon I will be financially successful.</p>
